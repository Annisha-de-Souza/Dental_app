##  Features

- **Disease Identification:** Classifies dental conditions (Caries, Calculus, Gingivitis, etc.) using a hybrid Vision Transformer model
- **Precise Segmentation:** Accurately highlights areas of interest (cavities, caries) in the input image using Mask R-CNN
- **AI-Powered Explanations:** Utilizes a fine-tuned GPT-2 model to generate clear descriptions of the detected disease and its symptoms
- **User-Friendly Web App:** Built with a React frontend and a Flask backend for easy image upload and result visualization
- **High Accuracy:** Our novel hybrid classifier achieves **99.12% accuracy** on the Dental Condition Dataset

##  Usage

1. **Upload Image:** Open the web app and upload an image of an oral cavity either from your gallery or by using your camera
2. **View Segmentation:** The app will first display the result from the Mask R-CNN model, which segments and highlights potential areas of disease
3. **Get Diagnosis & Explanation:** The final result page shows the disease classification from the Vision Transformer and a detailed, easy-to-understand explanation of the disease and its symptoms generated by the LLM

##  Models & Performance

- **Segmentation:** Mask R-CNN (mAP: 0.7)
- **Classification:** Hybrid Model (ResNet-50 + CNN + Vision Transformer) (Accuracy: **99.12%**)
- **Text Generation:** Fine-tuned GPT-2
- **Inference Hardware:** NVIDIA A100 GPU
- **Live Segmentation Speed:** ~13 FPS
